##Top Practical Angular Interview Questions and Answers | angular coding questions

1) explain the diff between one-way data binding and two-way data binding in angular

1 way data binding displays data from the component class in the template

eg-{{data}} or [property]="data"

2 way data binding allow for both reading and writing data
between the template and component class

[(ngModel)]="data"


3) make an HTTP GET request to retrive a list of products from a mock
API endpoint and display them in a component.


this.http.get("/products").subscibe((data)=>{
this.product=data;
})

4)create a form to add new product with validation

productForm:FormGroup;

this.myform.formbuilder(private fb:FromBuilder){

this.productForm=this.fb.group({
myformgroungname=['',validators.required,validators.minLength(3)],


}



4) set up routing a multi-page angular application.Create
two component,"Home" and "About" and configure navigation between them

app.routing.module.ts

const route:Route=[

path:'/home',
component:HomeComponent

path:'/about',
component:AboutComponent

]

use <router-outlet></router-outlet> in your app template to dispaly routed component


 5)  What is content Projection?

card.component.html:

selector app-card

<div class="card">
  <div class="card-header">
    <ng-content select="[cardTitle]"></ng-content>
  </div>
  <div class="card-body">
    <ng-content select="[cardContent]"></ng-content>
  </div>
</div>


<app-card>
  <div cardTitle>Title of the Card</div>
  <div cardContent>
    <p>This is the content of the card.</p>
    <button>Click Me</button>
  </div>
</app-card>

we're using the app-card component in the parent component. Inside the app-card component, we're providing content within <div> elements with the attributes [cardTitle] and [cardContent]


How can we use common css files for multiple components?
